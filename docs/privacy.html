The purpose of this app is to take into account all training sessions in the life of a swimmer, either in open waters or the pool.
For that, it needs to store the training session's data in its database.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is not in the aims of the author through Nadamillas to systematically or otherwise collect or share private data from individuals.</li>
  <li>The personal and sensible information this application has access to include:
    <ul>
      <li>For any swimming session, Nadamillas does only inputs information about the distance, time, date, and scenario (open waters or pool).
       This is needed for the app to achieve its advertised objectives.
       With these data VARSE will be able to calculate values such as the totals for a month a week or a year,
       among other advertised data which are also part of the objectives of the app.
       All this information is stored in the user's phone internal storage from where the user can retrieve
       it to obtain graphics and summary information from the sessions carried out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As mentioned earlier, all sensible information is stored in the phone's private storage, so no one except for the user herself can access them.
  <li>Nadamillas was designed for personal use only. The swimming session's data belongs to the user and the author does not access it,
      store it anyhow, or claim its ownership. Nadamillas nor the author share this information with anyone.</li>
